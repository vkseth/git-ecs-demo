ECR / Repository -

- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry service 
that is secure, scalable, and reliable. 
- Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM.


Task Defination - 

- A task definition is a text file in json format that describes one or more containers
- Configration related information can be mention here like operating system, which container to use,
which port to open, data volumes



Task -

- specify the number of tasks to run on your cluster


Services - 
- maintain the number of instances specified in the Task defination 
- You can use an Amazon ECS service to run and maintain your desired number of tasks simultaneously 
in an Amazon ECS cluster. 

- How it works is that, if any of your tasks fail or stop for any reason, the Amazon ECS service 
scheduler launches another instance based on your task definition. 
It does this to replace it and thereby maintain your desired number of tasks in the service.


Container agent - 
- The container agent runs on each container instance within an Amazon ECS cluster
- The agent sends information about the current running tasks and resource utilization of
 your containers to Amazon ECS
